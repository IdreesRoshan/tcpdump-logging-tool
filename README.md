# TCPdump Logging Tool
## Overview
This project is a simulated network security exercise where I worked as an Intermediate Network Administrator to investigates potential security breaches in an accounting firmâ€™s workstations. I developed a custom tcpdump logging script to monitor network traffic, filter suspicious activity, and store packets for forensic analysis.

Key Highlights:

- Setup and Packet Capture: Ran tcpdump on Linux to capture and filter network packets based on specific criteria.
- Logging Script: Developed a script to automate packet capture, filtering traffic from specific websites.
- Saving and Analysing Packets: Stored captured packets in .pcap files and analysed them using Wireshark.
- Sequenced Dump Files: Implemented automatic log rotation based on time and file size limits.
- Decrypting Traffic: Captured SSL/TLS keys, allowing encrypted traffic decryption and HTTP packet analysis in Wireshark.
